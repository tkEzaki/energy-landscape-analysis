# What is this repository?
Energy Landscape Analysis Toolbox (ELAT) provides functions necessary for the energy landscape analysis (Ezaki *et al.* *Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A* **375**: 20160287 (2017)). This software can be run on MATLAB2016 or later versions + MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
